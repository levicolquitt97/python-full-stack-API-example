This project's goal is to demonstrate my Full Stack capabilities using python to create an API that will take files from s3 and display them in a web app.

How To run:
  - download project
  - execute: pip install -r requirements.txt on your terminal
  - run site_tables.py

specifications developed to:

  We have images (.png) and a file containing image metadata (.txt) stored on s3. We would like you to write a Python API that can answer the following queries:


  - Get list of all images available

  - Download specific image

  - For a specific image, get associated metadata from the metadata file

  - create a simple frontend to select an image and display its metadata
